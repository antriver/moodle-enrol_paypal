# Moodle PayPal Enhanced Enrolment Plugin
Provides the same functionality as the built-in PayPal enrolment method, plus the ability to specify "prerequisite courses" and "conflicting courses" to allow/disallow enrolments as appropriate.

#### Prerequisite courses

The enrolment method will only be shown to the user if they are enroled in all of these courses.

#### Conflicting courses

The enrolment method will NOT be shown to the user if they are enroled in any of these courses.

## Setup

```bash
cd /path/to/moodle
git clone https://github.com/antriver/moodle-enrol_paypalenhanced.git enrol/paypalenhanced
```
