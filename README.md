# Moodle PayPal Enhanced Enrolment Plugin

It does the same thing as the built-in PayPal enrolment method, plus these additions:

#### Prerequisite courses

The enrolment method will only be shown to the user if they are enroled in all of these courses.

#### Conflicting courses

The enrolment method will NOT be shown to the user if they are enroled in any of these courses.

## Installation

```bash
cd /path/to/moodle
git clone https://github.com/antriver/moodle-enrol_paypalenhanced.git enrol/paypalenhanced
```
